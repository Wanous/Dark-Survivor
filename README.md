Dark Survivor is a game where your fighting differents waves of various ennemies (3 to be honest). The more your progress, more the ennemies will be **stronger** and **faster**.
 Your objectif is to survive the most waves you can. Every game you playing is different because the map is generated with the Perlin noise and the waves of ennemies are completely random.
